Iternity
--------

This is library is under heavy construction, NOT recommended for production use.

Iternity is a collection of tools and abstractions that evolved over the years,
to solve common problems and as well as some language design decision that I don't
always agree with.

The goal is the highest level of abstraction, the lowest possible amount of boilerplate,
as well as general experimentation, in the hopes of discovering new interesting
patterns and abstractions. In finding small pieces of abstraction that you can chain
together in endless ways, you can reduce a lot of boilerplate and low-level
distractions.

I've been influenced by a number of functional programming languages over the
years, as well as most of the underrated functional languages that are available
for python.

TODOs:

- more tests and more doctests
- extract the useful stuff from TEMP.py and remove the cruft
