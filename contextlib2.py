    Looks a bit weird but this is a bit like with statements work in
    some other languages (and a bit like ruby's tap, from where I
    stole the name), it simply saves a bit of typing.

    Example, assume you want to set

    long_object_name.long_attribute_name.foo = 10
    long_object_name.long_attribute_name.bar = 20
    long_object_name.long_attribute_name.baz = 30

    You could:

    with tab(long_object_name.long_attribute_name) as obj:
        obj.foo = 10
        obj.bar = 20
        obj.baz = 30
